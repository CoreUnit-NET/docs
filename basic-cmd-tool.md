# Cunet application cmd tool
Create a simple cmd tool to prove your skills and apply to CoreUnit.NET.
Its allowed to use AI and ask CoreUnit.NET Developers for exact requirements and also for **help**!

Create a example CoreUnit.NET cmd tool that downloads and processes a website.

As this tool is an application, there is no need to define a precise or logical objective.
But it will be better evaluated.

The tool should download a web page and then process it in some way.

Examples:
- Define a URL and download the website and all the resources linked to it into a directory and store the results in any kind (also change the linked paths to the new directory path).
- Define a URL and check if it has certain properties and store the results in any kind (html compressed?, css compressed?, js compressed?, inline css?, inline js?, check security header?, list all ref URLs with query parameters and list all forms).
