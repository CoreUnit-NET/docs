# Application
You apply to learn, collaborate and access some CoreUnit.NET platforms.
**This is not a paid job!**
We do not have a strict hierarchy, but Network Managers will grant access as needed and the person is trusted.

**One very important thing,** if we give people tools and platforms, it doesn't mean that we can teach them all the time.
**You have to learn for yourself,** but we can help you find the way and tools.

The application consists of 3 parts:

## 1. Google form
Fill out [this](https://forms.gle/Jo4hYGeW8ZCQRBES7) Google form as *introduction*.
Its needed to get general infos about you and test your knowledge about our used tec stack.

## 2. Discord server
Join the [cunet discord server](https://discord.com/invite/GJSbyJ5Jpe) and create a support ticket there.
**Please** mention in the ticket that you would like to apply and that you have filled the form.
*We use UTC as the default time zone and 24-hour format for agreements.*

## 3. Project definition
Find a project that suits you.
If you do not enjoy what you are doing, it is not worth it.
But we also need to find something that is useful for CoreUnit.NET and easy to prototype.

# Afterwards
Depending on your project, we will teach following basics:
- git concept,
- git-flow on github (as collaboration workflow),
- Linux container concept,
- Docker CLI & Dockerfile (as container tool),
- using linux server cli,

After that, we do not give you free access to our entire infrastructure.
We will give you the opportunity to develop your skills, use parts of the infrastructure as needed, and maybe host your own stuff.
