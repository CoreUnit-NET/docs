# Cunet application web service tool
Create a simple web service to prove your skills and apply to CoreUnit.NET.
Its allowed to use AI and ask CoreUnit.NET Developers for exact requirements and also for **help**!

Create a sample CoreUnit.NET Web service application that consists of a front-end and a back-end Rest API service.
You need to use **typescript** for the frontend and if you use javascript in the backend you also need to use typescript there with bun.js as runtime.

Example:
- markdown docs example
- sso oauth/oidc example
- git repo viewer in web (readonly)
- webservice to view docker containers on a host

Example stacks:
- vanilla js + bun express rest api 
- angular + golang + chi
- react + bun [NobleMajo/bunrouter](https://github.com/NobleMajo/bunrouter) rest api
- vue + golang + buildin router
- alpine.js + bun if router rest api
